# SER-225-Game

## What is this?
This is a platformer desktop game developed as part of SER 225 at Quinnipiac University. Working on a team with 4 other software developers, we took a simple game, repaired game-breaking bugs, and added more features and interactivity to meet the requirements of users. 

## How to run this project?
I used no external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box.
I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ (I developed this game using it) or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.
